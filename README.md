# ??? Weather Data Analysis

## ?? Project Overview
This project analyzes weather data for **New York, USA** using a dataset from **NOAA Weather Stations**.  
The goal is to study variations in temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and urban heat island intensity.

## ?? Dataset Details
- **City:** New York  
- **Country:** USA  
- **Years Covered:** 1980–1981  
- **Source:** NOAA Weather Stations  
- **Columns Included:**
  - Temperature (°C)  
  - Humidity (%)  
  - Precipitation (mm)  
  - Wind Speed (m/s)  
  - Urban Heat Island Intensity  

---

## Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values  
- Verified column data types  
- Ensured all numerical columns were valid for analysis  

---

## ?? Step 2: Data Exploration
Used Python (Pandas) to:
- View basic statistics using `df.describe()`  
- Identify year and month ranges  
- Understand trends across different weather parameters  

---

## ?? Step 3: Visualization
Created graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- **Temperature vs Month (Line Chart)**  
- **Precipitation vs Month (Bar Chart)**  
- **Wind Speed vs Month (Line Chart)**  
- **Urban Heat Island Intensity (Box Plot)**

## ?? Insights
1. **Temperature:**  
   - Increases from January to July (peak around 22°C)  
   - Drops after August — coldest in December–February  

2. **Precipitation:**  
   - Highest during May–September  
   - Lowest in February and December  

3. **Humidity:**  
   - Moderate during warmer months (30–50%)  
   - Slightly higher in colder months  

4. **Wind Speed:**  
   - Fairly stable (7–11 m/s) throughout the year  

5. **Urban Heat Island:**  
   - Average intensity ˜ 2 units ? mild effect

##  Conclusion
New York experiences **clear seasonal weather patterns**:  
Warm summers, cold winters, moderate rainfall, and stable winds.  
The analysis highlights useful trends for understanding **urban climate changes**.
